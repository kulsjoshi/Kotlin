// REST web services
//====================================

A web service is software-based functionality offered over the internet that enables your app to 
make requests and get data back.

Common web services use a REST architecture. Web services that offer REST architecture are known 
as RESTful services. RESTful web services are built using standard web components and protocols.

You make a request to a REST web service in a standardized way, via URIs.

To use a web service, an app must establish a network connection and communicate with the service. 
Then the app must receive and parse response data into a format the app can use.

The Retrofit library is a client library that enables your app to make requests to a REST web 
service.

Use converters to tell Retrofit what to do with data it sends to the web service and gets back from 
the web service. For example, the ScalarsConverter converter treats the web service data as a String 
or other primitive.

To enable your app to make connections to the internet, add the "android.permission.INTERNET" 
permission in the Android manifest.

//====================================
// JSON parsing
//====================================

The response from a web service is often formatted in JSON, a common format for representing 
structured data.

A JSON object is a collection of key-value pairs.

A collection of JSON objects is a JSON array. You get a JSON array as a response from a web service.

The keys in a key-value pair are surrounded by quotes. The values can be numbers or strings.

The Moshi library is an Android JSON parser that converts a JSON string into Kotlin objects. 
Retrofit has a converter that works with Moshi.

Moshi matches the keys in a JSON response with properties in a data object that have the same name.

To use a different property name for a key, annotate that property with the @Json annotation
and the JSON key name.
