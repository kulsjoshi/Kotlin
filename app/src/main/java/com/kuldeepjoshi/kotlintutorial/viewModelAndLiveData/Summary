LiveData:
==============
A data holder class that can be observed. Always holds/caches the latest version of data,
and notifies its observers when data has changed. LiveData is lifecycle aware. UI components
just observe relevant data and don't stop or resume observation. LiveData automatically manages
all of this since it's aware of the relevant lifecycle status changes while observing.

==============
ViewModel:
==============
Acts as a communication center between the Repository (data) and the UI.
The UI no longer needs to worry about the origin of the data. ViewModel instances survive
Activity/Fragment recreation.

==============
Repository:
==============
A class that you create that is primarily used to manage multiple data sources.
